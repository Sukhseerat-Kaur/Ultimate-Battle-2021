## ISSUES FACED AND LESSON LEARNT

- Making our Website RESPONSIVE : The main obstacle for us was to provide a good user experience when the site is being viewed on different devices. We used media queries to solve this issue.

- Pushing code to remote repository

- Animations

-Network Issues: We had network issues but we still managed to make things workout.

Every problem has a solution but one must know how to find it. For this project GOOGLE was definitely our life saviour

Working in a team reduces the work load.
